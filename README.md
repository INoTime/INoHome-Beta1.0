# INoHome-Beta1.0

At the moment only for UNIX-distributions!

INoHome is literally a program to check your garage status. If a garage is opened and you can not see the garage (analog) because it is for you out of range you could check it with INoHome. You can add a max. of 255 garages to the server and also to the client.

Have to know: At this time you have to build the app on your own. It is a Beta-Version download the Beta-Version from my Website: inoinvestigation.com/inohome.php or download it on Github: github.com/INoTime/INoHome-Beta1.0. Please read for more information the README.md file for every program also: INoHome Client, INoHome Server and INoHome Garage.

Next steps:

    add a camera in the garage to see what is happening in the garage
    control your garage with (maybe to send an command to open or close the garage with a normal radio key)
    make the program native to use it also under Windows - create an iOS and Android (native) app
